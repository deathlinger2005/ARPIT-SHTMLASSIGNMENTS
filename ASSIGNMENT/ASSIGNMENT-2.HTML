<h1>INDEPENDENCE DAY 2020- ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS.........</h1>
<p>Independence day- One of the greatest day in the history of India when we got freedom from the British slavery after 200 years of hard struggle. Independence day is celebrated annually on 15th of August to enshrine the first day of freedom of India and also to remember all the sacrifices of the freedom fighters wh did sacrifice their lives in getting the freedom so that the coming generations can enjoy an amicable and splendid life.</P>
<P>Post Independence people were not allowed to educate, eat heathly and live a carefree life like we do now. Only the Britishers were educated who treated Indians as their slaves, were not given their proper share even after so much of hard work, peasents were made to follow the meaningless orders of the Britishers, women were looked down and even stones were put on the thinking power of the people. It took Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru many years to eradicate the problems like Poverty, illiteracy, child marriage, dowry and bribery, though these problems still prevail in our system.</P>
<P>Every year a big commemoratory event is organised by the government at Raj Path in New Delhi where people of varied creed and culture congregate. The ceremony is inaugurate with the unfurling of the national flag and Twenty-one gun shots are fired in honour of the pensive occasion. This is  followed by a patriotic speech  by the prime minister of India who in his articulation highlights the achievements from the past years, throws light on the imperative issues and calls for added development.Indian national anthem, “Jana Gana Mana” is sung. The Idian Flag’s tricolor epitomies saffron for courage and sacrifice, white for peace and rightness and green for faith and valiance.</P>
<P>We gather on this day  to remember the great sacrifices of freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh, Lala Lajpath Ra,Rani lakshmi Bai, Jawahar Lal Nehru, Matahama,Chandra Sekhar Azad Gandhi Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. Students are given examples of these freedom fighters and are made to realize that if they want to achieve something in life it needs lot of sacrifies, hardwork and patience.</P>
<P>In schools, colleges, universities and educational instuitions  Flaf hosting ceremony is done usually by the prime member of the organization or by some eminent personality who is taking part in the ceremony as a chief guest. Cultural programmes are also organized by the students. Dominant government buildings are often decked up with lights. In some other cities specifically National capital, Delhi ,occasion is often graced with kite flying. National flags of contrasting sizes are used to embody fidelity to our mother India. People usually beautify their clothes and their sorrundings with tri-colour representing the Indian National flag. Some people celebrate in their own way by watching movies based on freedom fighters, listening to patriotic songs and going on outings with family and friends.</P>
<P>One day is  never enough to pay homage to all the freedom fighters, infact they should remembered everyday and held as a source of direction.</P>
