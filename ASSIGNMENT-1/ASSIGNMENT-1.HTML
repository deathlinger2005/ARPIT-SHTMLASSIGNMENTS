<h1> COVID-19 pandemic in India </h1>
<h2> <u> ABOUT COVID-19</u> </h2>
<P>
    <B> <I>The COVID-19 pandemic in India is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) </I></B> caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020. India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia,[8] and has the third highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States and Brazil[9] with the number of total confirmed cases breaching the 100,000 mark on 19 May, 200,000 on 3 June, [10][11] and 1,000,000 confirmed cases on 17 July 2020.</P>
<P>
    <B> <I>India's case fatality rate is among the lowest in the world at 2.41% as of 23 July and is steadily declining.</I> Six cities account for around half of all reported cases in the country – Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata.[13] As of 24 May 2020, Lakshadweep is the only region which has not reported a case. India's recovery rate stands at 63.18% as on 23 July 2020.[14] On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.[15]
</P>
<P>
   <B> <I>On 22 March, India observed a 14-hour voluntary public curfew at the instance of the prime minister Narendra Modi.</I></B>  It was followed by mandatory lockdowns in COVID-19 hotspots and all major cities. Further, on 24 March, the Prime Minister ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, affecting the entire 1.3 billion-person population of India. On 14 April, India extended the nationwide lockdown till 3 May which was followed by two-week extensions starting 3 and 17 May with substantial relaxations. From 1 June, the government started "unlocking" the country (barring "containment zones") in three unlock phases
</P>
<P>
   <B><I> In March, after the lockdown was imposed, the United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization (WHO) praised India's response </I></B> to the pandemic as 'comprehensive and robust,' terming the lockdown restrictions as 'aggressive but vital' for containing the spread and building necessary healthcare infrastructure. At the same time, the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) noted the government's swift and stringent actions, emergency policy-making, emergency investment in health care, fiscal stimulus, investment in vaccine and drug R&D and gave India a score of 100 for the strict response. Also in March, Michael Ryan, chief executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme noted that India had tremendous capacity to deal with the outbreak owing to its vast experience in eradicating smallpox and polio.[20][21][22] Other commentators have raised concerns about the economic fallout arising as a result of the pandemic and preventive restrictions.[23][24] The lockdown was justified by the government and other agencies for being preemptive to prevent India from entering a higher stage which could make handling very difficult and cause even more losses thereafter.

<h2> <u> TIMELINE </u></h2>
<p> <B><I> On 30 January, India reported its first case of COVID-19 in Kerala,</I></B> which rose to three cases by 3 February; all were students returning from Wuhan. Apart from these, no significant rise in transmissions was observed in February. On 4 March 22 new cases were reported, including 14 infected members of an Italian tourist group.[36][37]</p>
<P> <B><I> In March, the transmissions grew after several people with travel history to affected countries, and their contacts, tested positive.</I></B> On 12 March, a 76-year-old man, with a travel history to Saudi Arabia, became the first COVID-19 fatality of India. </P>
<P> <B><I> A Sikh preacher, who had a travel history to Italy and Germany, turned into a "super spreader" by attending a Sikh festival in Anandpur Sahib during 10–12 March.</I></B> Twenty-seven COVID-19 cases were traced back to him.[41] Over 40,000 people in 20 villages in Punjab were quarantined on 27 March to contain the spread.[40][42] </P>
<P> <B><I> On 31 March, a Tablighi Jamaat religious congregation event in Delhi, which had taken place earlier in March, emerged as a new virus super spreader event,</I></B> after numerous cases across the country were traced back to it. On 18 April, the Health ministry announced that 4,291 cases were directly linked to the event.[43][44] </P>
<P> <B><I> On 2 May, in Punjab, around 4,000 stranded pilgrims returned from Hazur Sahib in Nanded, Maharashtra.</I></B> Many of them tested positive, including 27 bus drivers and conductors who had been part of the transport arrangement. Till 13 May, 1,225 pilgrims had been tested positive.[45][46][47] </P>
<h2> <u> GOVERNMENT RESPONSES </u> </h2>
<p> The outbreak has been declared an epidemic in more than a dozen states and union territories, where provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 have been invoked, leading to the temporary closure of educational and commercial establishments. All tourist visas have been suspended, as a majority of the confirmed cases were mainly imports.[48] State governments took various measures to contain the spread of the virus. </p>
<h2> <U> TESTING </U> </h2>
<p> The Union Health Ministry's war room and policy making team in New Delhi consists of the ministry's Emergency Medical Response Unit, the Central Surveillance Unit (IDSP), the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and experts from three government hospitals.[50] They are part of policy decisions to decide how coronavirus should be tackled in the country.[50] A cluster-containment strategy is mainly being adopted, similar to how India contained previous epidemics, as well as "breaking the chain of transmission".[50][51][52] 15 labs across India led by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, are testing for the virus, with more labs being trained, as of early March.[53] On 14 March 65 labs were named capable for testing for the virus (though as of 17 March not all are fully functional).[54][55][56] </p>
<p> On 14 March, scientists at the National Institute of Virology isolated a strain of the novel coronavirus. By doing so, India became the fifth country to successfully obtain a pure sample of the virus after China, Japan, Thailand and the US.[57] The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that isolation of the virus will help towards expediting the development of drugs, vaccines and rapid diagnostic kits in the country.[58] NIV has shared two SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with GISAID.[59] On 16 April, China sent 650,000 testing kits to India[60] but their use was discontinued in view of a very low accuracy (of just 5.4%).[61] In May, National Institute of Virology introduced another antibody test kit ELISA for rapid testing, capable of processing 90 samples in a single run of 2.5 hours.[62] </p>
